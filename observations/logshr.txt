This bird was very roughly about the size of a slim, sleek American Robin.  It was a slightly darker than-- medium gray on its forehead, dorsal head, nape, dorsal neck, and dorsal torso.  A wide, black mask (lores and auriculars,see photo) separated the gray of the forehead, crown, and nape from the white chin and throat.  The bill was black, not long, and thick (too short for NOSH).  Its chin, throat,  ventral torso and dorsal rump area were all whitish with the throat being a brighter white than rest of the ventral surfaces.  The dorsal surface of the tail was jet black except for its lateral edges and what seemed to be its posteriolateral corners.  The views of the bird in flight were too brief and distant under windy conditions to be sure of the exact extent of the white in the tail.  The bird also showed white panels in otherwise black wings, but again, views of the bird in flight were too brief and distant under windy conditions to be sure of the exact extent or location of the white in the wings.----Location: seen perched on primrose stalk on edge of large, sandy bowl-shaped depression between two knife-edged dunes at approximately 46.661689, -86.034305.

Smaller than Northern with no barring on the chest.  It appeared short-billed and I did not notice any lightness to the base of the lower mandible.  The dark gray back and head contrasted sharply with the black mask and wings giving it a clean look.  The white patch showed in flight.  The bird was first seen as it flew from the ditch below me to a bare tree along the property line.  Knowing it was a great bird I confirmed the ID with my 10x42 Swarovski's before getting my phone and taking a quick shot with its camera through the Swarovskis.  I only had 5 minutes to get to work so I knew I could not get out my spotting scope.  I wish I had my 300mm lens to get a better photo.  I was unable to refind the bird at my lunch break or after work.

Observed shrike using fence posts and wiring from post to post as perch. Maybe 20-30 feet from road. Flew down into grass several times. Through scope could see shorter beak than any northern I have seen. Less pronounced hook on bill. Black mask appeared still broad at beak. Pale stripe above eye and black mask was hardly there. In flight, rump appeared more gray than white. Behavior-wise, kept to low perches, no tail-flicking, and when it flew off, kept close to ground.

HY bird with no brown tones in the fringes of upperwing coverts, no barring on breast, relatively stocky bill and face pattern that matches HY LOSH.

Nest successfully located in a spruce tree between the shoulder of CR-408 and the chain link fence of the airport. The tree is about 15 feet tall with dense branches near the base. Nest is about four (4) feet above the ground near the trunk of the spruce. Nest is well camouflaged and hidden, a bowl-shaped nest with a tight cup in the center and loose material on the exterior, creating a shaggy appearance. Four eggs were observed within the nest, the eggs were small (about one (1) inch in length) and speckled with brown (see photo).----One additional adult Loggerhead was observed, totaling two adult birds. These two individuals are presumably a mated pair, given the presence of a nest. The two adults maintain a presence near the nest, perching on the nearby fence (most often), on the tops of small trees (less often), as well as on snags in the field where they seem to be hunting for prey. While perched the adults exhibit a bobbing tail motion, flicking their tails up and down every few seconds. The field adjacent to the nest site has been plowed and planted, and is quite large in size. Surrounding the field is a forest edge habitat, with mixed hardwoods (primarily beech and maple) along most of its perimeter, with red pine and low scrub around the rest. ----When approached, the parent birds emit a grating alarm call while splaying their tail feathers. Often this takes place from the chain-link fence or from atop the spruce tree containing the nest. No other vocalizations have been observed.

A quick inspection of the nest yielded photos of the young. The nestlings are still covered in fuzzy gray feathers, and their eyes are open. A black mask is visible around their eyes and lores. I estimate that the young are about 8-12 days old. The observation of the nest was brisk as the adults nearby were aware of my presence and warned me with grating alarm calls. ------ UPDATE -- As of August, 2013----Observations of the Loggerhead Shrikes were not made for a couple of weeks after this observation on July 25, 2013. When I returned in mid-August, an adult Shrike was present. When approached, it maintained a close association with a short pine tree farther to the east down CR-408 from the nest site. I did not see the young, presumably fledged birds, but I assume that due to the known behavior of parent Loggerhead Shrikes to continue feeding their young for several weeks after fledging, the young were within the tree.----Based on the observation of the nest with eggs on June 27 and the partially grown chicks on July 21-25, I can make a rough estimate that the eggs were laid in late June (25-27). The estimates are based on an incubation period of 15-17 days and a nestling period of 16-21 days. I estimate that the eggs hatched in early to mid-July (11-16). The young probably fledged in late July to early August (Jul. 30-Aug. 6). These approximates coincide with the observation of the eggs, hatched young, and finally, the probable fledglings with the adult observed later in August.----A full report of these Loggerhead Shrikes was submitted to the MBRC on July 23, 2013.

Upon closer inspection of the nest, I observed that the nest now holds four (4) nestling Loggerhead Shrikes. Small fuzzy gray feathers coat the nestlings, which are situated facing outwards from the nest, with only their eyes and the tips of their beaks protruding from within the nest. The birds must have hatched between June 27, when the nest was first located and found to hold eggs, and today, July 21, when the young nestling shrikes were found. Comparing my photos to those of other, age specified photos, suggests that the young are about 6-10 days old. ----One adult bird was observed atop a nearby tree. The other adult was not present, accounting for the decrease in individual species count of adult shrikes. The other adult was away from the nest, perhaps hunting.

When I arrived, it was sitting on the utility wire along the road. As we watched, it made several forays to the shrubs along the ditch and would then return to the wire. When I left it had moved into a tree about 30 yards from the road. I also spotted a small, furry rodent speared on a thorn next to the ditch which I suspect may have been a future meal for the shrike. I believe Brian told me the last Loggerhead Shrike reported in Manistee County was in 1992.

Found at 9:00am by Curtis Dykstra, relocated by Rick Brigham and many others an hour later, and found again by myself and a few others following that.----Observed from a two-track just beyond a large woodchip pile (cross the boardwalk, take a left at the fork, and then take another left before the fence.  Walk past the woodchip pile about 10 yards).  Scoped out the fence, rocks, and trees atop the berm behind the fence. The shrike spent the majority of its time below the berm out of sight, but did appear in the trees along the fence and the trees above the berm for a few minutes, cooperating for good scope looks by all.----For photos, see <b><a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID&#61;S18148357">Rick Brigham's checklist</a></b> or <b><a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID&#61;S18148021">Carl Manning's checklist</a></b>.  Non-diagnostic photos obtained by me at 24x, but will not be posted until Thursday evening.  Thick black mask, strong white bar on wing, not bobbing tail, and no barring observed on underside. No diagnostic looks obtained in flight.----<i><b>(A)</b> Observation point beyond the woodchip pile.--<b>(B)</b> Trees atop berm in which shrike spent majority of time while visible.</i>--<a href="https://maps.google.com/?&t&#61;p&z&#61;16&q&#61;42.821302,-86.181964"><img src="http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center&#61;42.821302,-86.181964&zoom&#61;16&size&#61;800x400&markers&#61;color:blue%7Clabel:A%7C42.821302,-86.181964&markers&#61;color:red%7Clabel:B%7C42.821163,-86.183382&maptype&#61;hybrid&sensor&#61;false" /></a><a href="http://birdventurebirding.com/"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5dHlsU3JLWM/UARfvvu80qI/AAAAAAAAA7M/ZWt0sUCNHoA/s89/tiny.png" /></a>----This may very well be one of the last LOSH to be seen in the lower peninsula of Michigan.

First reported earlier in the day. Upon arriving the bird was interestingly perched up at the VERY TOP of the trees within the fenced in area (this is when the photo was taken). It then moved to a lower perch and I proceeded to watch the bird with some other birders south of the wood chip pile. The bird hung out in the lower branches of the tree for about another 10 min before flying off behind the berm. ----The birds head and bill had a very rounded appearance. The bill seemed shorter and always sloping to the tip as opposed to a slightly more elongated NOSH bill. No white around lores or above eye seen, solid black between eye and bill.

Underparts were not barred. Song probably heard, but possibly a mockingbird imitator (we didn't watch it sing). Most of these details are visible in photos, which we will upload ASAP.

Seen by at least 11 observers through 4:20pm, flying from perch to perch, mostly spruces, in yard in open country, occasionally diving into grass after prey. Good scope views as close as 75 feet in good light. Similar to our annual Northern Shrike, but with stubbier black bill, slightly hooked at tip, and with broader black mask. Otherwise grey above, white throat and undertail coverts, pale grey below, with black on upper tail with white edges, black wings, white wing patches, black legs. Casual (?) in eastern SLP. About the 166th state record (if accepted by the MBRC), and a first 'official' county record if accepted, though I'm aware of one unofficial record from Jeff Schultz in the last 20 years. No eBird records for the county. Fair to middling photo coming.

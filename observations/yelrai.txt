Small rail (approx size of a Ground Dove) with conspicuous white secondaries; back boldly striped black & buff with fine white cross hatching; short tailed; dangling feet.

The rails had short bills and yellow stripes on a dark back.  They were both in the sedges along the mud flats. no vocalizations heard.----Sora Rail was eliminated due to the white secondaries and smart more dramatic yellow striping to the back and Virginia Rail was eliminated as both birds had very short yellow bills.  We were sure there were two present as one was kicked up just after the other and they flew off in different directions.  Keith also saw the birds well and agreed with my identification.

It had a buffy face with a dark eye-line and dark crown, a short dark bill, the back had heavy dark brown and buffy streaks and underside was buffy with light streaks.  This bird appeared exhausted but quickly hid in the dune vegetation.--The larger sora has longer legs and larger bill.

With infinite patience, we got so close to this invisible skulker, I feared that taking a step might crush him.  Had no idea until he popped out a few feet away that yellow rails either create tunnels beneath the sedge mat or use tunnels created by other small mammals.  This fellow popped out like a mouse or a winter wren for a few seconds, took one look at us and disappeared.  Appreciating the great honor bestowed upon us,  actual visibility in broad daylight, we retreated.

Thankfully, the bird called twice at pretty close range while we were there. As expected, we never got to see it, but that is how it goes with that species. Temp ~70F, clear skies, light breeze. A nice conclusion to the day.	Continuing bird. Called once at 7:26 and again at 7:37. Distinct metallic clicking, as of two spoons being clicked together. It is somewhat reminiscent of a cricket frog call.

I only heard the rail call off one for about 3 or so seconds around 9:15am. I was not able to wait around much longer because I had to be at church by 10:00am.

Instead I heard a Yellow Rail--not a bad trade off! I gave Jonathan a call and he showed up about half an hour later, and eventually it piped up again briefly. ----Weather: mostly clear, cold (~35°F--lots of frost on the sedges early on), light wind (maybe about 1 m/sec, picked up substantially by the end).	First heard at 8:11AM--a length burst probably 7-8 seconds long. Then, it gave a shorter (maybe two-second) sequence of calls at 8:15. I called Jonathan and he showed up around 8:45--in the entire meantime, it did not call, and it did not respond when Jonathan played tapes. We tried stomping around, but of course we didn't get lucky and flush it. Finally, at 9:15AM, it gave a very short call sequence--just 3-4 notes--and we left.

Ended up thinking that the sedge wren area not far from the parking area looked best, though I thought the water level seemed high. Stopped at a few spots and played YERA call from the first few hundred feet of boardwalk. Got no response, so I turned to walk back to my car and a Yellow Rail flushed from right beneath my feet. It was very low light, but the bird was larger than a sparrow, but not by much, looked light brown, and flew very briefly for about 20 feet and landed in the grass again. It then did single click notes, unlike the usual cadence, but certainly not consistent with the calls of other rail species. I wanted to hear it do the traditional ticking pattern so I hit the tape once more. I heard and saw the grass rustle as the bird rushed to right beneath my feet again (fullish moon and clear sky). I waited for the call but heard nothing. The bird then retreated about 10 or 15 feet. I waited another thirty minutes with no response.

No stones used.  Yellow Rail heard doing the click, click, click click click call at 11:13PM.   I've attached a recording I made.  The listener will have to listen hard but the clicking can be heard.  The clicks are heard best beginning at about 40 seconds.   I walked towards the clicks as I heard them probably explaining why it takes a while to hear them later in the recording.  ----I only heard it call once even though I waited another 30 minutes.  I can't say if it called more from further away and I could not hear it over the water.  I did not want disturb this rare bird with recordings or stones to try to force a better recording.

Staff had heard the tic tic calls near there. We saw it crossing the road on the driving loop around sunset. From a distance it looked like an American Woodcock from buff breast and streaking on side, but didn’t move like a woodcock. Slowly drove up to the spot and it was standing just off the road next to our van window. Much smaller than woodcock. Short stout bill. Contrasting streaking on sides and back. Dark streak through and under the eye. Saw it from about six feet away for about five seconds before it walked a few steps away and blended into the cover. The two of us who had seen it well from the passenger side of van looked at our books trying to find something similar. We didn’t discuss what we thought we had seen until after we separately reported it to the Seney visitor center staff. They asked us each many questions about the bird and exact location and then showed us a stuffed Yellow Rail. It looked exactly like what we had seen.
